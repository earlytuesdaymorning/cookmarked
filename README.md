# COOKmarked

## Description and Features

I have always had trouble keeping track of recipes I have used and enjoyed, especially since there just seems to be an infinite amount available in the age of the internet. In comes COOKmarked! A simple-to-use way to keep track of recipes that you come across and create. It's incredibly easy to share with friends and family simply by sending a link! Don't like a recipe? Change or delete it with a few clicks! You can also look at a universal list of recipes to see what other users are making!

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.9.13
* Django 4.0.6
* HTML, JS, CSS
* AWS S3
* Heroku
* Materialize 1.0.0
